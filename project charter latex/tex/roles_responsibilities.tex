%Peter's Part
\textbf{Peter Dang}\newline
Some strengths that I possess would be some Embedded and Electrical Hardware skills that I can put on the table. I am pretty comfortable with the Embedded Systems work while continually working with students as a T.A. I can also contribute a little bit as a Scrum Master since I am quite familiar with everybody in the group, and can exchange information with others to meet deadlines.
